# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-08-29

## 1. Overview
- Product: Virtual Try-On (Chrome extension)
- Developer: Individual developer
- Contact: hengshiousheu@gmail.com
- Summary: Your photos and (optional) API key are stored locally in your browser’s extension storage. We do not run our own backend or analytics. If you connect a model provider with your own key, requests are sent directly from your device to that provider to generate try-on results.

## 2. Scope
- This policy covers only the Virtual Try-On browser extension. We do not operate a separate website.

## 3. Information We Process
- Photos (local only): Images you upload are stored locally in your browser’s extension storage.
- API key (optional, local only): If you enter an API key for a model provider (e.g., OpenRouter), it is stored locally in extension storage.
- Settings (local): Preferences like base URL and model ID are stored locally.
- When you generate results: If you choose to connect a model provider, your selected photo and the garment image URL are sent directly from your device to that provider to produce the try-on image. We do not proxy these requests through our servers.

## 4. What We Do Not Collect
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your photos, API keys, or settings to our servers (we do not operate servers).
- We do not run analytics or tracking.
- We do not operate a marketing website.

## 5. How We Use Information
- Provide core features (upload/manage photos, generate try-on results).
- Communicate with your chosen model provider only when you initiate generation and only if you connected a key.

## 6. Sharing and Disclosures
- We do not sell personal data.
- Third-party providers: None by default. If you connect a model provider with your own API key, your data is shared directly with that provider only to produce the requested output. Your use of that provider is governed by their terms and privacy policy.
- Legal/safety: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights and safety (not expected given we don’t operate servers).

## 7. Data Retention
- Extension data (photos, API keys, settings) remains on your device until you delete it via Settings (“Clear All Photos & Key”) or uninstall the extension.
- We do not retain copies on our servers.

## 8. Security
- We use reasonable measures in the extension’s design to protect local data, but no method is 100% secure. Keep your API key confidential.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
- Not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). Do not use if under the applicable age.

## 10. International Transfers
- If you use a third-party model provider, your data may be processed in other countries under that provider’s policies.

## 11. Your Rights
- Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data. Since data is stored locally, you can delete it in the extension’s Settings. For provider-held data, contact that provider directly. For other privacy questions, email hengshiousheu@gmail.com.

## 12. Do Not Track
- We do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals (no tracking is performed).

## 13. Changes
- We may update this policy. Changes will be indicated by the “Effective Date” above.
